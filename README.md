# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Basic Python Project](Basic_Python_Project/README.md) | Analyze IMDb data on TV shows from the “Golden Age” era to test if highly-rated titles also receive the most votes. Focus on validating this assumption through data-driven insights. |
| 2 | [EDA Project](EDA_Project/README.md) | Analyze a modified Instacart dataset to uncover customer shopping habits. Clean the data, handle missing & duplicate values, & create insightful visualizations with clear labels & titles. |
| 3 | SDA Project | Analyze data from 500 Megaline clients to compare revenue from Surf & Ultimate plans. Identify which plan earns more to guide ad budget decisions. |
| 4 | Intro to Machine Learning Project | Build a classification model to recommend Megaline’s Smart or Ultra plan based on subscriber behavior. Aim for ≥75% accuracy & validate performance across multiple models & hyperparameters. |
| 5 | Supervised Learning Project | Build a model to predict customer churn for Beta Bank. Aim for an F1 score ≥ 0.59 & compare it with AUC-ROC. |
| 6 | Machine Learning in Business Project | Build a model to predict oil reserves and identify the most profitable region for a new well. Use bootstrapping to assess profit and risk. |
| 7 | Integrated Project | Prepare and analyze gold recovery data to build a predictive model. Validate recovery calculations, explore metal concentrations, and handle anomalies. Train models, evaluate with sMAPE, and select the best one using cross-validation. |
| 8 | Linear Algebra Project | Use machine learning to support marketing & benefit prediction for Sure Tomorrow Insurance. Build models for customer similarity, benefit classification, & regression. Develop a data masking algorithm that preserves model quality. |
| 9 | Numerical Methods Project | Build a model to predict used car market value for Rusty Bargain. Focus on accuracy, speed, & training time. |
| 10 | Time Series Project | Build a model to predict hourly airport taxi demand for Sweet Lift. Aim for RMSE ≤ 48. Resample, analyze, train, & evaluate models to guide driver allocation. |
